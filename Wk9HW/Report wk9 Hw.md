- Domain: Clean Water and Sanitation/Hygiene and it's effects on human death rates

- The visualisation above represents the share of deaths attributed to unsafe water sources from 1990 to 2019

- There were 3 transformations done
  - One was for the hover box for countries which no data was available such as for the Russian federation 
  - The second one was for the Year slider to show changes in the share of deaths per year per country
  - The last is still in the works, but is to show which country has the biggest share of deaths
  
- As for the map idiom used, the easiest and more coherent type would be the choropleth map which uses a sequential colour theme to show higher/lower proportions. This allows for readers to see which countries have a higher proportion of the share of deaths and those who do not just by looking at darker or lighter colours
